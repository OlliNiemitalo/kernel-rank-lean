# The semigroup theorem in nonstandard language

This file proves `M t = exp (t A)` the way a nonstandard analyst would write it, with the
vocabulary of `Ultrapower.lean`: an infinitesimal step `ε`, natural extensions `ext f`, infinite
closeness `≈ₕ`, standard parts and transfer. The argument is that of
`NonstandardSemigroup.lean`, whose header explains it; that file works with sequences along
the ultrafilter instead. The only ordinary estimate, `norm_replace_steps_le`, is shared.

The interface has only one-variable instances of the transfer principle. For that reason the
scale `η`, the number of steps and all other quantities are ordinary functions of the step `h`,
evaluated at the infinitesimal `ε`.
